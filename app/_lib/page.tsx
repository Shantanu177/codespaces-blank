// Private folders in Next.js are useful for organizing and managing sensitive files or
//  resources that should not be accessible to the public. These folders are not served
// by the Next.js server and are not accessible through the browser. They can be used to store configuration files,
// API keys, or any other sensitive information that should be kept private. To create a private folder in Next.js,
// simply create a folder with an underscore prefix (e.g., `_private`) in your project directory.
